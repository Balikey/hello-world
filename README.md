# hello-world
Am a fast learner and quitting is not an option.
Learnig how to become a backend developer, github.com 
made it simple and possible.
Though at the beginning I had no clue on how to go
about it, thanks to the #announcement, #discussion, 
#backend and i also had to use Google and YouTube.
Learning is a continuous process and am not afraid to
learn.
